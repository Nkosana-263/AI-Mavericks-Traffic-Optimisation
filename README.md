# Traffic Optimisation and Urban Mobility - AI Mavericks

## Overview
This project is part of AI Maericks' submission for the ITU WTSA 2024 Hackathon. The proposed system leverages AI/ML models for traffic forecasting and real-time dynamic traffic signal optimisation to reduce congestion, and improve urabn mobility. By integrating data from CCTV cameras, weather APIs, and event schedules, the project aims to optimise traffic light timings, contributing to **SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities**

## Key Features:
- **Real-time traffic data**: Using an object detection model for vehicle counting from CCTV cameras.
- **Traffic Forecasting**: Generates a multi-horizon forecast of traffic volume based on past traffic data, forecasted weather and data about scheduled events.
